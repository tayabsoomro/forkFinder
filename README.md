#### Introduction  
Fork Finder is an application that allows us to find the common ancestor in terms of the taxonomy tree of two organisms. For example, if you want to find how similar *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Plasmodiophora brassicae* are to eachother, you will put the two names in the application and it will return **Eukaryota**, indicating that these two organisms are in the same domain.
